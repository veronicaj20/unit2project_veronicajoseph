LinearEquation class:

Instance variables:
    private int firstX - this represents the x coordinate of the first point
    private int firstY - this represents the y coordinate of the first point
    private int secondX - this represents the x coordinate of the second point
    private int secondY - this represents the y coordinate of the second point


Constructor
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
         firstX = x1
         secondX = x2
         firstY = y1
         secondY = y2

Methods
    public String slopeAsFraction(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        double num = y2 - y1
        double denom = x2 - x1
        return num + "/" + denom
        // returns the slope of the line as a fraction

    public double slope(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        // returns the slope as a double to be used in other methods

    public double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        // returns the distance between the two points

    public double getYIntercept(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        // returns the y intercept

     public double solvedYCoordinate(double newX, double yIntercept, double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
        // solves for the y coordinate based on the new x coordinate given by the user

    public String toString()
        // returns the string of printed information

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: implement Scanner
Step 2: ask user for the first coordinate
Step 3: ask user for the second coordinate
Step 4: use the toString() method to print out the information (first and second coordinates,
        slope of the line, y intercept, the slope intercept form, and the distance, rounded
        when needed)
Step 5: ask user for a third x value
Step 6: calculate the y value using the methods to get the y intercept
        to solve for the new y coordinate, given the user's inputted x value
Step 7: print out the respective coordinate point
Step 8: end the program
